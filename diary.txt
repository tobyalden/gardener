Just arrived. Sky was the color of sherbet when I got dropped off. Tomorrow I start my new job as a remote farmer. Not exactly thrilled, but it's only for 30 days. Job itself is pretty simple. Program the robot to till the soil, drive over the tilled soil and plant seeds, water them everyday, and harvest the plants once they're fruiting. Shouldn't be too bad. Gonna get some sleep now, night.

Done with my first day. It's weird to see the field out of my window but not be able to go outside. The trailer's already feeling cramped.
Skimmed the manual last night. The robot's pretty typical - 5 program slots that accept all the standard cards: Move, Turn, Till, Water, Copy. Once you've slotted five cards you can run the program once, twice, or four times (I guess it's more time efficient to run the same program multiple times). Not as exciting as the mod clusters they use for big commercial contracts, but it'll do.

Done with my second day. Noticed something unsettling about the cards I've been getting from the satellite. They're supposed to send the same ones each day, but every day they're different - it almost seems random, like the satellite's glitching or something. Sent an email about it this morning, but haven't gotten a response back yet. Who knows how bad the packet loss is out here - hope they see it. Otherwise they're gonna be pretty annoyed when they come pick me up.

TGIF, right? Got a response back, finally. Apparently they're "looking into it". Very condescending.
I have to admit though, it's nice having a place to myself finally. Especially after having to share bunkbeds on the ship in. Those dudes made me seriously uncomfortable.
It feels amazing to finally get a good night's sleep.

Another day. Spruced up the trailer a little. Put up a mirror on one wall so I can check myself out while I work. Even if no one else sees me, it's fun to dress up a little.

Sunday, 10/6/43:
Sunday's my favorite day of the week. Even in a trailer, it feels special. Listened to a whole album with my eyes closed to celebrate.

Monday, 10/7/43:
Watching the robot move around through the window, it struck me how weird it is that I haven't talked to anyone in six days. I can't begin to imagine how weird I'm probably getting without realizing it. 

Tuesday, 10/8/43:
Played videogames after work today. Spun up a copy of an old MMO I used to play with my friends in school and wandered around the empty world for a bit reminiscing. I can't believe how much time I wasted playing this thing.

Wednesday, 10/9/43:
Today I noticed someone had graffitied a heart onto the side of the robot. Very cute! I hope it's always been there tho... O_O

Thursday, 10/10/43:
Woke up in the middle of the night last night and threw up, then felt fine afterward. I guess it's not uncommon for this stuff to happen in recycled environments, but it's still a little worrying.

Friday, 10/11/43:
Was bored today and read a little about the history of this colony. Apparently it was a testbed for some of those early bioadaptation experiments. I guess when those flopped the company behind them sold it for agriculture. It's hard to believe people thought someone could survive out here.
