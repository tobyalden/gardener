Just arrived. Sky was the color of sherbet when I got dropped off. Tomorrow I start my new job as a remote farmer. Not exactly thrilled, but it's only for 30 days. Job itself is pretty simple. Program the robot to till the soil, drive over the tilled soil and plant seeds, water them everyday, and harvest the plants once they're fruiting. Shouldn't be too bad. Gonna get some sleep now, night.

Done with my first day. It's weird to see the field out of my window but not be able to go outside. The trailer's already feeling cramped.
Skimmed the manual last night. The robot's pretty typical - 5 program slots that accept all the standard cards: Move, Turn, Till, Water, Copy. Once you've slotted five cards you can run the program once, twice, or four times (I guess it's more time efficient to run the same program multiple times). Not as exciting as the mod clusters they use for big commercial contracts, but it'll do.

Done with my second day. Noticed something unsettling about the cards I've been getting from the satellite. They're supposed to send the same ones each day, but every day they're different - it almost seems random, like the satellite's glitching or something. Sent an email about it this morning, but haven't gotten a response back yet. Who knows how bad the packet loss is out here - hope they see it. Otherwise they're gonna be pretty annoyed when they come pick me up.

TGIF, right? Got a response back, finally. Apparently they're "looking into it". Very condescending.
I have to admit though, it's nice having a place to myself finally. Especially after having to share bunkbeds on the ship in. Those dudes made me seriously uncomfortable.
It's great to finally get a good night's sleep.
